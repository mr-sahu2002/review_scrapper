Review
"I researched for a budget-friendly laptop for over a month and after juggling between different brands and models, I finalized this one. Trust me, I am not at all disappointed. This is one of the best laptops out there. The best part is it comes with a 2-year warranty. And, you know if the company is providing you with a 2-year warranty then your product will stay safe for at least 3-4 years.

Amazing Touch. Amazing Screen. Smooth Keyboard.
I have an eye condition because of which it's quite hard for me to focus but this laptop has made my life easy. I swear if your budget is 40-50k, go for it. You won't regret buying it.

I bought a keyboard cover and a sleeve too just for extra protection but I don't think there's any drawback that I've noticed to date."
"This is a good laptop with lot of pros and a biggest con, which is it's screen. Let me share the positives first.
1. Light weight and compact (even with a 15.6"" screen)
2. No heat and fan noise
3. Super fast SSD and 8GB ram.
4. Smaller charger brick ( though not type c)
5. Good performance
Main negative is on the display.
1. Even though it's 1080p quality is no way near it.
2. With 250nits brightness, it's just white
3. Colors and absolutely dull.. Not at all punchy
4. Screen is TN display and not IPS, so you know how the viewing angles will be.

I bought this with my old laptop exchange, and some deals with a price around 25k. For that price I'm happy, but not worth it for 42k."
"Been using this laptop as a replacement for my trusted Acer that I had used for almost a decade and I must say this laptop has been doing well for the past two plus years now. The only hassle I have had is with the browser, Microsoft Edge that would randomly hang and even change font size etc of the laptop, sometimes requiring a reboot. I switched to Chrome and the problems went away. The only other problem I have had is finding one day that the USB ports will not work. Thanks to the Lenovo Vantage app that comes with the laptop, I was able to a BIOS update (do it carefully or use a Techie if you are unsure of updating the BIOS) and everything turned back to normal. I have the updated the BIOS on another occasion but that was just to update the Laptop and not for any problem. The Laptop itself is light compared to my earlier Acer and the battery life is decent for now. Updates are regular and it does them in the background if it has been set that way. I would recommend you still use a free Antivirus such as Avira on top of the defender that comes with Windows for a double protection against viruses and you should be fine. I am not a gamer but use graphics for artwork moderately using Gimp and the laptop handles all this wonderfully."
"At first I want to say, this is a genuine review about LENOVO IDEAPAD, SLIM-3, i3 11th gen 8gb 512 SSD,

At first day I dislike this laptop because the battery goes down from 100 to 27 in a single night with out swtchon it. And also I used this for my Solidworks work which gets laggy a lot, so I setup my mind to return this. The return process is so much difficult here as lenovo guy will come to check for the issues with laptop then it will exchange instead of return. But lately I know that there is a problem with my software. Because other softwares like Inventor, autocad, fusion 360 and catia are working flawlessly in this laptop. Battery is good. And i cancelled my return immediately.

Cons-. Sound should be higher,
Display brightness should be a little more,
Finger print security is not available.
Metal frame will be better if provided..

Over all I get this at 37990 in offer and a great deal for now.."
"Well with all the specifications of the laptop I thought this was a good deal during prime sale... Laptop was good.. But after 11 months I got a dead led line on the screen and also the keybaod started to give issue with the Letter 'I' button automatic getting pressed and the letter 'O' not working at all, also the curser on the laptop was also getting stuck and the laptop got sluggish even with memory available in the ssd.. Also the wifi is not good.
This all problems I faced within a year.."
"It works great for daily use but I am disappointed by the display quality. Hardly visible from side angles and brightness is very low. Also the colors produced looks washed out.
So, if you are planning to buy this for something that is colors related, avoid this laptop."
"Awesome purchase ...writing this review after using it for a month almost...

"Hands down, Amazon India has the worst customer service in India.They issued a return and refund for the faulty laptop but 3 times they didn't come and pick the laptop and each time I had to call the customer service. Each time they just repeat themselves and we have to just listen to them as we don't have any option. 4th time They placed the order for return and today is Monday 19th,Sep 2022 and the next pickup will be on Thursday. That is the kind of service we have from Amazon.
Customer service is rude and a bunch of liers.

I am waiting for the faulty laptop to be returned for almost 3weeks now.

Laptop key(Page-up) is making squeaky sound.
[I returned the laptop and bought the same model again as they were not giving replacement and unfortunately, I faces the problem with spacebar this time. SO,I can confirm that keyboards in this model are defective or average quality(not recommended).]
Laptop plastic is not strong, it looks ordinary,especially when you hold them by the sides.
Keyboard quality is very average. I bought this laptop based on my previous experience with lenovo G570 which served me well.
Battery was good(5hrs including an hour of youtube) based on 1st day of usage.
The Usable storage is 430 GB SSD. My earlier Lenovo had usable storage of 460GB approx.

Pros:
1. Boots pretty fast.
2.Internet is faster. I compared the download and upload speed on both the lenovo laptops and this new one works faster. I tested it for 5 times atleast and everytime, the laptop has significant speed difference of more than 7-10 MBPS(Download and upload)."
"I satisfied this product, very nice, I order laptop and wireless but I received laptop only, wireless mouse missing, please will arrange my order for wireless mouse."
Price has sky up and according to that specification is low...But the plus point is what they said is what given.
