Review
"I am a student using this laptop for coding, studying, entertainment, video editing, and 3D Modelling. Here are the pros. and Cons. I have noticed till now:
Pros:
-Everything works like a charm without slow downs
-I can have many things open without having to worry about ram
-It is quite (cause it doesn't have a fan)
-Super long battery life
-The simplicity and beauty of the mac os user interface (ui)

Cons.
-When doing intense work for long periods, it does heat up and there is no way of dissipating the heat apart from letting it sit idle
-When connecting a mouse to it via a usb-c dock, natural scrolling needs to be disabled for it to work like it does on any other computer, however, when using the trackpad, natural scrolling needs to be enabled for the same, there is no way to disable and enable it for mouse and trackpad respectively at the same time and needs to be done manually
-The camera quality could have been better
-For some reason the pinch to zoom function of the trackpad doesn't work as intended in apps
In all, this is a beautiful machine made with the intention of allowing people to do their work without much hindrance and is not made for gaming."
"1. Performance:
The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.

2. Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.

3. Fanless Design:
The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.

4. Portability:
The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.

5. Compatibility:
The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.

6. Rosetta 2:
Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.

7. Price:
The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.

8. Integrated Graphics:
The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.

9. Limited Port Selection:
The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.

10. Upgradability:
The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase."
"I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).

Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.

Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.

Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.

OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.

Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.

Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?"
"I bought it during sale and got it for 70000 and trust me it’s the best laptop in this price range , pros-
1). Build quality is too good and best
2) battery backup is very good and impressive
3) laptop is very much light weight and easy to carry even in single hand
4) the laptop does not have fan but still it does not heat much
Cons-
1) limited storage and no chances of upgrade , you need to buy ssd for extra storage which is quit expensive
2) less number of ports , it comes with only two usb c ports and you have to buy external port hub"
"What a sound!! Since I have to use it for Music purpose, I am really very happy with the sound quality and over all everything is excellent."
"I've been a life long a windows user-
I wasn't sure if I would be able to use macOS.
But in just 3 days I learnt it enough to get started. I have used it to learn data science projects and do coding python, sql, using tableau, vscode etc. That is 80%of my use case

Rest 20% is entertainment-

Pros-
Battery life is amazing, easily 10-12 hours if not more.
Very lightweight and good for bed use.
Never heats up or laggs, no need to shut down.
Always all my projects and codes are running and no lag what so ever.

Never used a laptop with better trackpad and gestures make life super easy.

Microphone and noise cancelation is superb, thanks to apple's technology.
Speakers are too good to enjoy and streaming content for hours without worrying about charging. Cracked apps also work for ms office if you want.

Cons- camera isn't 1080p if that is a priority.
I wish there was more ram but not a problem because of apple's memory swap technology.
M1 is faster than m2 for memory swap which is good for multi tasking. Or go for m3 if you can."
"I got my product delivered earlier this week. My first impression was that it is thinner than I had anticipated, which is great. Looks sleek, but is very powerful. Though I admit I haven’t done much expect some streaming, browsing and document creation work, it has worked flawlessly so far, with absolutely no lag. I would say that despite only 8 GB, it would beat any 16GB, Core i5 PC hands down on performance.

The display is good though if you have used an FHD LED display, you may notice the difference, especially the black colour. But it is not a major issue.

The biggest advantage is the battery. After the first full recharge, I used it for around 14 hours before I charged it again with 24% remaining. This could be the single-largest attribute in its favour. The keyboard looks premium and keys are easy to use.

In summary, a great choice even in 2024. I would like to see how it performs on some light programming / compiling activities, but I am sure it will perform well there too. Very happy so far."
"Sometime it doesn’t open with hand due to very tight hinge

Otherwise the laptop is best. I got in 62K"
"Pros : Well designed, excelent bright display , superb sound quality , convienient lighted keyboard , overall superb !
Cons : While on power mode the tracking side has slight electrical discharge albiet slightly and managable if you are wearing a shoe or a chappal . But may not be suitable for a child! Apple must take care of this trouble."
Best compact device around 67K ! Nothing can get wrong with these devices. Definitely a good buy.
