Review
The laptop is good for daily office use. No problem at all. Highly recommended at this price.
Worth for money and nice design quality is good . Iâ€™m using for 3 month performance good
"Lenovo laptop are always better battery life great, speed great, price much cheaper then any other brand, quality are great, also performance are smooth, sound quality good,screen quality good, display quality good, appearance good"
Display quality not good .
Useful item
Sometimes hang or slow speed otherwise good product under 25k
Over and all was satisfactory
It came without printed invoice and warranty. I could download the invoice and print it. The warranty is garbage. Some garbled text looking like Fortran code. And I don't know how to get from Amazon without going through a maze which takes me nowhere.
Only issue with the display. Rest all good as per the specification and price.
very nice
