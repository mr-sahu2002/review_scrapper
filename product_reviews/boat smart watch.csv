Review
"Amazing watch. Very hard built. Lasted for my rugged use for 3. yrs.

Last month the watch stopped working for few days, after 10 days , it started working like before and iam planning to reorder the same watch again . Value for money. Highly reliable"
"This smart (model Boat extend plus) watch is functioning well. Worth for price at Rs 2300/-
Battery, in the beginning it lasted for 5 days and in the next charge it lasted for 3 days and last it settled to one day. I am not an extensive user of apps.

AMOLED display is good.
Touch feature is good. Access to apps is easily reachable. Simple browsing features.

Sleep measurement is good. It is taking day time naps. But night time it's showing exactly when went to sleep and when I woke up.
SpO2 measurement is neaarer to the measurement of my personal digital instrument.
Heart rate measurement is also nearer to this instrument.

Stress is also reflecting nearly my real condition.

Activity: Steps showing correct. Distance is also good but this watch is taking the bike ride as walking and showing when distance covered the set target.

Sports features I haven't checked yet fully. But I checked that the features are functional.

Water resistant - yes it is water resistant. I have checked while bathing and in drizzle of rain.

Time display is good. The number of displays available on cloud is sufficient for me.
Always on .. feature is working. Only model is available for this feature, which is not pleasing to me. There could be a few more skins made available.
Display off and on when wrist is put to rest and raise respectively. This feature is only functional when the feature of Always On is enabled. Otherwise it's not functional.

Bluetooth calling feature is good. Speaker is loud enough to take call. Useful in listening to audios and videos while walking.. ofcourse battery drains quickly.
Messages: yes, it's good. We can see the notifications.
Flash light is functioning. Ok.
Camera, weather, calender, stopwatch, timer, alarm, breath are functioning.
Find phone is beautiful.

Settings are functional and are sufficient. It could be improved further to fine tune the functions.
It's not measuring the heart rate etc when it is placed on surfaces other than human body. (I didn't check with animals.)
..........
Cons
Music volume is not that responsive. It's not controlling the audio of the app in real time.

We cannot open and read the individual messages.

Calender is for only current month. We cannot check the dates of rest of the months.

Boat App is also good on my android Vivo phone. No issues with syncing.

....
I bought this watch to check the peaks of BP of my mom, especially during night time. Of course the manufacturers have not claimed the measurement of Blood Pressure. It's ok.

Now I am using this have satisfaction.
....
My overal experience is good."
"Best gift for Teen kids.
Boat built quality good.
Boat software interface with phone is good.
Good connectivity, you can read your Whatsapp message in the watch.
I recommend this product."
"Skipping the parts mostly covered in other reviews and sponsored yt ones, I will add few irritants and common sense disappointments I noticed since last few days of actual usage of this NOT so smart watch:

1.AOD do not show date & day of week. Only shows hour and mins. No way to configure it beyond analog/digital view. It also gets turned off when you start any exercise activity like walking. So the screen goes dark when you go for a walk!

2. Calory count on home screen or anywhere else only shows step counts calories but not an aggregate calories burnt through exercise activities. I.e if step cals = 100 and cycling = 90 then it will only show 100 on home screen and separate two entries in app. Its not smart enough to do the addition.

3. No quick way to go to and start the activity/exercise. First press side button twice then select activites list from menu. Versus Swipe up from home screen goes to utterly useless cricket score screen instead which many even won't use. No customisation of these menu options to functionality mapping provided.

4. There is no touch to wake display available on screen. This is available on my 1800 rupee, 3 yr old huwai band 4! One has to press the side button every time just to see the home screen,which is utterly inconvenient to reach to.

5. There is no day/night time auto on/off configuration of AOD or 'twist to wake' provided making it irritating during sleep hours if kept on. Thus daily two times a day its a task to enable/disable these features manually.Every freaking day!
Kindly also note that there is indication, whatsoever, on AOD about the started exercise activity! So you start one, like outside walking, come home, and then after two hours discover you forgot to turn it off when you press the side button to activate the watch face screen!

6. Unable to detect 20/30 mins power naps during the day time and add it to total 24 hr sleep tally. Only counts night time sleep hours that too with the average accuracy. As said before, not smart enough to do the simple math!

7. Charging is fast but with even the AOD and BT calling disabled battery drains considerably in a day. Magnetic charger has its own down side e.g. gets disengaged at a minor twist tension on the charging cable.

8. For activating the weather and cricket score features, user has to accept some opaque and unknown 3rd party (separate from Boat OEM opaque data privacy ones ) end user data usage policies. Without enabling GPS and/or contact/call logs access to mobile app none of these two features work. Which is very suspicious given their intended usage. Feb 23: After recent firmware update, now just to sync the data the mbl app needs gps turned on! O.w. it doesn't 'connect' to the watch over Bluetooth!

9. If you remove the watch from the wrist and keep it aside, it keeps auto counting the heart rate and adds that lower count to average heart rate statistics! So to say it doesn't count the things to count and keeps counting the things not to count!

10. Since installing the mobile app 'cove' I am observing rapid battery drain despite of restricting all the permissions and keeping bluetooth off. The bluetooth and sound level control functions of the phone are also randomly impaired for some unknown reasons and need phone restart to resolve.

11. Sedentary remider most of the times do not get triggered when you are stationary but is notified after you start moving around!

12. Cove App pushed firmware update completely wiped off all watch device setting preferences and resetting watch to all default settings, including the watch face, AOD, brightness level! The update also creepily asks to enable the gps without which it do not proceed! Now why does firmware update needs GPS??

Its obvious that most of above issues/limitations can be easily fixed by software fixes and updates. But real question is do these so called dozens of smart watch chinese clone companies bother to give that much attention to details? And we know unfortunate answer to that question."
"The watch is very nice üíØ and worth for buying. But I ordered Crusador Knight Black üñ§ colour but the dealer send me Knight Black üíõ. I tried too for replacement but no one either delivery boy came.
The watch is good , light weight, scratch resistant and the watch faces are also good. Alexa is very useful to me but it only work until it was connected to mobile,etc. . That's why I gave 4‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê because wrong product is ordered and nothing to replace.

Thanks you."
It was very nice good quality
Amazing watch does the job well ..
Ii is nice smart watch. But belt is so poor .belt was cracked with in five months only.

Design, Build & Comfort
When buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.

Boat Xtend design and build
I personally don‚Äôt like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don‚Äôt look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.

Boat Xtend design
The watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.

Display
Coming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won‚Äôt notice the bezels, and the screen quality won‚Äôt feel cheap at all. It doesn‚Äôt have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.

Boat Xtend display quality
I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn‚Äôt something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn‚Äôt much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won‚Äôt find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that‚Äôs why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won‚Äôt find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won‚Äôt prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won‚Äôt be a problem.

Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won‚Äôt be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven‚Äôt noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don‚Äôt find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn‚Äôt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."
