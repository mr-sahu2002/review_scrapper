Review
If you are looking for a midrange laptop for a quality gaming this may be good for you. It has been one year since I bought it and it is still performing very well as it should. It comes with Intel i5 and Nvidia GTX 1620 grafics. It has 2 SSD slots and one HDD slot. It comes with 500gb SSD pre-installed. Full HD display with 144hz refresh rate. I have played pubg pc and fortnight on the laptop and it runs excellent. I will in future try to play more powerful games. There is sound from the fan while gaming but it is not very troubling sound. The battery won't last if you are playing without pluging in the laptop and it will also affect the performance of the game. Plugin the laptop and play games for a better experience. On normal use the battery lasts about 1 hr to get from 99% to 20%. While gaming if you're not plugged in the laptop tries to save the battery and run the GPU which will affect the game and laptop performance and the battery also drains very fast. Charging speed is average. It takes about 1hr to charge from 20% to 99%. The laptop is heavy about 2.5kg. it doesn't have Microsoft office 365 free version in it. You have to go online to use it freely. The Xbox gaming pass is available free for 3 months but you have to give your debit or credit card details and activate your card for international usage. This laptop is best option for midrange gaming and acer also has an excellent service if anything happens.
"I ordered on 6th July n received on 7th. Appario seller
About the pdt: AN515-58
12500H 12 core
GTX 3050 4gb
1 TB hdd
500 gb SSD
8 GB Ram 3200 MHz
( need to add 1 more 8 gb for gaming)
One more slot is free for nvme SSD and ram upgrade it seems.

The laptop is working and in good condition. The product was mfd on May 2022. The warranty details are available in acer website. The warranty card from Amazon has the product snid. Cross check once you receive the item. Ran dxdiag to view system information. Always use a cooling pad with gaming laptop.

But for upgrade, you cannot do it your own as there a warranty void sticker pasted on one of the screws in the middle. You might need to take it to service centre for upgrade if you don't want to void warranty. ( In my old dell laptop there is only 1 screw for back panel but this one has 11 screws. check disassembly videos.)

I haven't checked the performance and battery life. Need to test some games on weekends.

update:
I played RDR 2 online and it is working smoothly. no stuttering issues after upgrading ram to 16 gb. Battery back up is ok.. you might get 1-2 hrs max based on usage which is good considering gaming laptop.. you cannot expect more..

if you are looking for laptop for moderate gaming and good battery backup like 3 or 4 hrs then this is not for you..

For extended warranty, visit acer site , use your account used to setup acer laptop and link your device then extend within 15 days. Also check the warranty certificate information in acer website. If you find any discrepancy or needs to update purchase date or customer name or address etc. raise an acer support ticket along with Amazon invoice and warranty slip to correct it. They will do it within 1 or 2 days. Then you can extend the warranty for 2 more years.

I am happy with the purchase."
"Not going to lie, I had my suspicions while ordering this laptop. Mainly because the specs it was offering for the given price was highly unlikely. I being an architect use these heavy rendering softwares. So it was imperative that the RTX series paired with 16gb Ram should be enough for a decent run. It indeed was. It did glitch once or twice, that could've been due to overheating. I have been using this for almost a year now, and I am quite happy with it. I would advise to buy the 16gb variant though as the 8gb one lags sometimes."
"I bought it around a month ago here are some pointers as my review..
Pros:
1. Single core processing is the best for this range. You can easily do any single heavy task at a time
2. Screen/ display quality is amazing
3. Built qality is superb
4. Could do wonders with a little extra ram
5. Didn't see any screen flairs (white spots) as mentioned by other reviewers.

Cons:
1. There are minor glitches in between the usage of 1 month. Im not sure whether its because of low-high voltage whole charging or something else.
2. Multitasking gets a little slow while you run the laptop on 8gb rams (i suggest getting 8gb more installed)
3. Since its a gaming laptop, don't expect the battery to go for more than 3-4 hrs
4. This is the most important con, the design is so great that it attracts fingerprints easily. If you dont mind keeping your laptop like a hostel kid, you can ignore this point."
"I always found Acer products to be good value for money but my latest experience has been different. I bought the laptop in early 2022. The laptop used to heat up a lot, but otherwise functioned well. Till last month, when the screen started getting black and the laptop needed frequent rebooting. Now, the laptop has no network connectivity and has been diagnosed with a problematic motherboard. I gather several customers had faced similar problems after 6 months."
"I bought this laptop about a week a ago and it has impressed me so far! It is expensive, yes but it pays off. It has excellent performance in gaming and it has 0 lag. The i5 11th gen processer is an excellent processer, Good for students and for gaming. The webcam quality is good too. The speakers aren't the best but they do the job, Also, for those who think the speakers are bad, you can simply just put on headphones. The keyboard lighting is amazing!!! Acer nitro 5 is one of the best gaming laptops out there if you have a budget up to about 70k. One thing to keep in mind though is that it is a little thick and bulky and a little heavy but you can still carry it around. Just be careful while carrying it or you might drop. They keyboard typing keels good and the build quality is solid. Battery like is pretty good. One more advantage is that you can charge it on the back so there aren't to many wires on the sides of your laptop. Thermals are excellent too! You can also adjust fan speeds and keyboard lighting in the nitro software. Overall, I really enjoyed this laptop! I highly suggest buying it."
"I needed a laptop for Data Science projects that I can do personally even without the Google collab. For my purpose it is doing really well. I had to upgrade the RAM though since in DL tensorflow with huge datasets 8 gb was not able to hold it in memory. Thermals are good in CPU and GPU. Only part that goes much hotter than other is the bottom right side. SSD tends to heat up significantly during extended model training. After 6 months till now haven't faced any issue except RAM constraint. System is really upgradeable and with an additional and better SSD and RAM upgrade performance improves leaps and bounds. 500GB SSD and 16GB additional ram costed me extra ₹9500, which is a much better deal than 16gb variant.
Note: Using external cooling solutions during extended period of model training to keep the longevity and sustained performance of device."
"I purchased this laptop in a hurry when suddenly my mid-2015 macbook pro went dead. I use it primarily for software development purpose and so far the perfomance is good. I have upgraded the memory to 16 GB and added one more 500 GB SSD. I am not a gamer, so won't be able to comment on gaming performance. However, running application server, eclipse, 25+ chrome/edge tabs and photoshop together hasn't shown any noticeable impact on the performance. I mostly use it with external monitor, mouse and keyboard. Apart from a few typical glitches with Windows 10, I haven't faced any major issue so far. Planning to install Ubuntu/Centos on a separate partition soon. Two minor drawbacks are: battery backup is not very good, and camera quality is very basic.

Overall, happy with the performance."
"I have received my laptop last week and this review is based on one week usage.
First of all when I initially set up the laptop there was windows 11 update option but after some time its not showing the same even though the system is fine.

About the display and built quality it provides the best at this price range.

For normal usage I got a battery backup of around 4-5 hours ( streaming videos on youtube, word, powerpoint, browsing, movie etc.)

I am not even a gamer but I have tried some game for the sake of evaluating performance. It was found that the temperature during the gaming will be around 80-92C.

Stylish design, weight is balanced and can open the screen with one hand.

As a student who wants to do some cad works, analysis, watch movies and for gaming it’s a perfect choice in this price range.
Just bag it if it is below 70k."
"Writing this review after about 9 days of using the laptop.
I have been using a desktop all throughout, and this is my first laptop.

First the cons:
a) Battery life is very moderate, will always have to take your charger with you.

b) The lid of the laptop feels weak compared to even much older lenovo laptops that have a strong metal lid.

Pros:
It's not just the CUP/GPU, but I am liking other aspects of this laptop too.

Webcam: The webcam is very clear and even better than my lenovo FHD usb webcam that I had for my pc.

Sound: Sound in games and music is very, very good. The same songs are sounding so much better on this laptop compared to my desktop, on my external speakers. In some games I actually had to turn around because I felt the sound was coming from my room. Very clear and realistic sound.

Keyboard: Very much like typing on the keyboard and the lights are very cool to look at.

Trackpad: Lot of useful shortcuts, including 3 finger and 4 finger shortcuts too.

Gaming: Dark Souls III does not even load the GPU/CPU full and runs at absolute max with even nvidia control panel at max

Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition: With ray tracing set to ultra, the game looks absolutely beautiful.

Overall, except for the weak top lid, I am liking everything about this laptop, especially since I got it for Rs. 58000/- with an exchange.
Hope this review helped."
