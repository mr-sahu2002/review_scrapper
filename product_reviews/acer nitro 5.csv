Review
"Got the acer nitro 5 around 10 days ago. Did some testing of games and got very satisfactory fps in all games I've played. So far I've played GTA V, Warzone, Avengers and Minecraft with SEUS PTGI. One thing to note is you cannot play any games properly until you upgrade the ram. I upgraded my laptop to 16 GB from 8. This is very crucial because you get only 4.1 gb of usable ram stock which is not enough for any game to run smoothly. After the ram upgrade, I'm really happy with the laptop and it was definitely worth the money. Loving the screen. It gets pretty decent brightness and the 144hz is smooth.
There are reports of bottlenecking from other youtubers but this won't affect you much if you play on ultra settings. I was really impressed with the warzone gaming on ultra with raytracing enabled. Minimum 80 fps in heavy explosion scenes. But the FPS remains constant around 95-105 with the settings as max as it can be even more than the max vram limit of warzone."
"I am writing this after 3 weeks usage

Pros
Latest Nvidia RTX
Overall performance is good
Good ventilation
Screen refresh rate is 144hz
Seller delivered on time
Build quality is great
Manufacturing quality is great

Cons
There is heating after continuous usage for 30 min
The LCD backlight bleeding is annoying even black screen just brightens up

Heating on heavy usage is the only concern for me, all the latest games run in max settings, on average I get between 60+ fps but on heavy usage for over 1hr it drops to 50-60.

Games I tested are:-
Call of duty Warzone
Read Dead redemption 2
Metro Exodus
Hellblade

I would say if you are looking for 100+ fps gaming it might not be a good option but it delivers 60fps for all latest games. For professional YouTube gaming it just manageable but don't expect desktop performance. You can trust this laptop for build quality that is for sure."
"Let's cut to the chase, I recently bought this laptop and believe me, I was terrified after watching youtube videos and reviews regarding bottleneck, still i went ahead and made the purchase, cause, of course, RTX!

No doubt the ryzen variant is better than this one.

I wanted a laptop, which could run ALL the games SMOOTHLY with considerable graphics quality, but in return I got thisss..... I mean look at the performance at the ultra settings! they're awesome!
ik it bottlenecks but whenever I play games at max. settings and look at the visuals, I forget about the bottleneck issue.

Yeah u can buy gtx 1660ti/1650 or whatever, but I may suggest one thing, gtx laptops in this price range won't give you a better performance than this laptop and that's a fact.......gtx won't bottleneck, but also it is not gonna give you the performance this laptop gives, you can go ahead and compare the fps on youtube which other laptops in this price segment are giving.

If you really want to just play games casually like me (ignoring the fact it bottlenecks), go ahead and buy this, just upgrade it's RAM to 16gb, buy an additional cooling pad and you're good to go."
mat lena max ram capacity 8 gb hi hai.. no need to buy ram capacity is only 8 gb. waste of money
"Review after intense testing for 2 days. Kudos to seller for delivering it in 1 day.

This laptop is not worth it, go for better alternatives at similar price range. Yes, this has a 3060, yes, it is the cheapest 3060 that you can buy right now, but beware of it's performance. It is a 85w TGP RTX 3060 paired with an i5 10300H a 45w TDP quad core octa thread processor at 4.5Ghz boost clock powered by a 180w brick.

Laptop looks cool. 144hz display looks amazing, it is on the warm side though. Has 4 zone RGB lighting. More than capable cooling system. Has 2 NVMe M.2 slots, of which one is already used for the WD 256GB SSD. Comes with 8GB RAM with a slot free. TBH if you REALLY wanna buy this laptop upgrade it to 16GB soon as you get it coz it is required to get something decent enough out of it.

I've tested GTA V mostly 70 to 80 offline & 60 to 70 online, Fallout 4 mostly 80 to 90 but dips to 50 to 60 in busy areas, Watch Dogs 2 around 40 to 50 (severe bottleneck), Metro Exodus with RTX ON mostly 60 to 70 & RTX OFF mostly 70 to 80. Each one played for around 5hrs straight at 1080p ultra settings. THE CPU BOTTLENECK IS REAL. Max clock that cpu will attain is 4.2Ghz and is locked so can't be changed. At this rate you will get worse overall performance than a 1660ti or 2060 paired with an i7. Don't buy it just coz it has a 3060 like me. It is the worst pair imaginable. Honestly, wait for ryzen version or skip this one and go for helios 300 with RTX 2060."
"Summary- for the casual gamer, video editor for you tube income stream, and Multi display system for various needs like stock market etc

Better than expected decent build quality, tad bit heavy by right sized and weight but can’t expect a hardcore 3060 card in a slim light design.

Impressive cooling features yet to use to full capacity. Cooling is 45 degrees to 50 degrees in normal use unlike what others have faced here.

Beauty is no restrictions on software limits as yet. Am not a hard core gamer but we can’t change laptops every few years - I still use my 10 year old Aspire so it’s only an insurance against time.
Even OEM 8 GB ram is very fast despite and due to the small ssd as seen earlier in Fujitsu too. May add to 32 GB ram and 2 TB pci ssd after a year after warranty expires as I plan to use for a long time like my aspire that’s ten years old and still running thanks to Microsoft for its upgrade tweaks that works on older laptops.

Value for money and available on time after waiting for a year. Half the cost of my original budget at 40 k ‘discount’. Truly amazed.

Safer to use a well known chassis and other hardware than worry about how a new design may work.

So that’s why it was worth the really long wait for the 3000 series graphics card."
"I'll come straight to the point. This laptop is a waste of money, my friends PC with a 5500XT, yes a base level card performs far better than this, it performs worse than a laptop 1650Ti. I have regrets buying this laptop, I hope to get a refund.
Conclusion: Not value for money, get a alternative laptop with 1660Ti or RTX 2060 MSI with i7 10th gen"
"Hi all.
Purchased this laptop with an exchange and got it for 80k roughly. I wanted to exploit DLSS for 4k 60Hz full eye candy gaming, and the extra CUDA and Tensor Cores for Deep Learning.
For gaming its true that the Core i5 10300H is a weaker processor coupled with the RTX 3060, but there are ways and means to remove the bottleneck, if you know and can optimize your systems well. The RTX is a 80 W TDP with a 5 W dynamic boost. The bottleneck is not more than 5-6 %. I play mostly AAA single player games and for my use case its the perfect combo. I don't play multiplayer at all.
The laptop runs cool and with some tweaks, it doesn't go beyond 70-75 on highest settings.

One recommendation is that one must upgrade to dual channel 16 GB RAM, and an NVME drive to fully unlock the potential of this machine.

For those sitting out on the fence and struck with dilemma, I say go ahead, if your use case is like me. Don't trust the current crop of cringe Indian YT reviewers who are eager to diss on systems which they have never laid their hands upon."
"I'm not sure if I have received a defective product, but the laptop runs really really hot. Even if I play *any* game for 15-20 minutes, the CPU temperatures easily reach up to 92C. The GPU on the other hand performs beautifully and runs cool (60-70C). This is with CoolBoost enabled. CoreTemp and the built in Nitro sense app confirms the heat.
I'm really worried about the product's longevity.

On a normal usage (without playing any games + a cooling pad) it still reaches 80-85C. I have only had this for a couple of days, but if the heating continues, I may request a replacement.

I'm curious to see if it's just me or others are running into the same.

I will update the review in a week once I use it more over the weekend."
"Let me tell something very straight. If you know how to optimise your laptop, you will never get the so called ""bottleneck"" or ""low gaming usage"" or ""heating"" issues. Yes it will heat up, but what more can you expect from a laptop? It is you who has to optimise it accordingly.
I bought this laptop in April 2021 and by far this hasn't given me any issues.. I have tested Cyberpunk 2077 (the full game with RTX on) and it touches 60fps,with rtx off it gives me 80+ fps on ultra settings.
I play COD Warzone and Black ops cold war on a REGULAR basis and it has never disappointed me. With proper optimisation both the games give me 100+ fps. CSGO gives 300+ fps, and the 144hz is smooth as butter.
Only a small tip - Upgrade this laptop to 16gb RAM to unlock its full potential.
Donot believe in cringy youtube channels telling this and that issues. Many of them have no idea, and criticize a setup without even showing the benchmarks. And add their famous 'like karo subscribe karo' bullsh*t.
I would say, go for it. Won't disappoint you. Just make sure of the 16gb RAM."
