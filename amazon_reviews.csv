Over and all was satisfactory
It came without printed invoice and warranty. I could download the invoice and print it. The warranty is garbage. Some garbled text looking like Fortran code. And I don't know how to get from Amazon without going through a maze which takes me nowhere.
Only issue with the display. Rest all good as per the specification and price.
Everything is super this laptop except mouse pad experience and it is not shutdown properly
good
"This is good one for normal use..

No heating while charging and useing
Received with 9 month as a warranty periods ,spoke with lenovo and increased to 1 year ..
System will auto strat whenevr open the lip..( default function)

We should take care of charging port.. not good quality...

We must buy keyboard and mouse this price range we cannot except type c charge and quality keyboard..
I'm satisfied.."
"Very slim and Great Product..
Fast access"
Excellent Product with better Performance using for more than months without any trouble.
Bahut must hai
This is very interesting product I am not expected such a good finishing of the laptop body and it is very light weighted
Thank you Amazon
"Pros-
Superfast, no lag
Lenovo's included vantage and voice softwares are good
Keyboard is okay
Lightweight battery life around 4 to 5 hours in real world
CONS-
SCREEN IS NOT UPTO MARK
THE COLURS ARE WASHED UP AND IT DOESNT GET VERY BRIGHT
The ports are really tight (if you plugged in a 2.4ghz mouse adapater in there good luck removing it)
Only 2 usb A ports
The type c port doesn't support direct charging.
My personal experience - the first one I got had to be replaced beacuse the screen turned off on its own during setup, but the replacement procedure was fast."
It has big screen
"This is a very fast laptop plus light weight.
Comes with a good battery, which can last upto 8 hours of continuous office use or medium use.
When playing heavy gaming battery will run out in 3 to 4 hours.
Only minus point is the screen if you compare this with your amoled screen and you want a laptop with good screen so by some other laptop."
"nice laptop because of it's generation is 12th, very fast laptop. only cons is it's display is not IPS and sound volume is not loud but support dolby atmos environment. In my laptop the left side speaker sometime create tattering sound. it's body is not of metal but looking great because of nice finishing. I have purchase it in Rs. 41000 during the great indian sale."
Good to go... Have everything in budget laptop... Not any issue while using for a month.
Works very very well for an i3. Very good and recommended buy
Good in normal budget
"Overall good.. But sound output is low.. Not expected in this price. Moreover, display quality is not satisfying. Its a average display. My old lenovo laptop have give me far better sound experience. I don't no why this laptop sound output is less than a cheap mobile.. I am disappointed. Also have 1mp poor camera..Go for HP."
Such a good product thanks Amazon
"ALT key not working, Initially It was not detected, after one week only we could check.
I am trying to contact service centre.But no response"
"Original product
Good prices"
Laptop is good with working
Nice Product
"Very quick booting of the system , speed is good enough for my personal work, I won't play games , volume is ok"
"I got i3 11 th gen instead of i3 12 th gen..
Recently return but offer over."
I got used product and not replaced
"If provision of high range (Volume) of memory is impossible in SSD, HDD could have been provided. Nowadays, minimum 1TB will only serve the purpose."
Nice
Good product this price.
Average performance
üëå
"Meet the expectations. Love it
Had issue with warrenty but I called customer service and they told me to send email with my invoice as a proof of purchase. And they solved the problem within a day. Got it for 40k with mouse."
"Good in performance, Stylish overall a good combo."
Happy with my purchase
Backwash h
Windows 7 instead of 11! Haven't figured out the Office; claims 2021!
Awesome design and build quality... Good battery back-up..overall it's a nice product at this price range. üëç One can go for it.
Value of money
not upto the mark
To use the product you should be able to log into it
"Product is exactly as described with latest Intel gen12 i3 processor. Its value for money for normal family usage with large screen, super fast SSD drive and enough RAM"
